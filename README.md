This is a challenge of RocketSeat where i had to code in one week the front and back end of one website. The following codes were at the starter path.

To the front end i used HTML+CSS+JavaScript+Express. It does have 3 mains HTML which i came up with a template to avoid typing much. 

In the back end, i created a server, worked with nunjuck and worked with the database. had a lot of troubleshoots to deal with but apparently i manage how to deal with it.

About the program itself: It's a web page which has 4 pages named "Ecoleta", the front end pages have all the texts in portuguese. 

This web-site should be used to register places around Brazil that do recycling, this should be used by places that provide this kind of service or by anyone who wants to collaborate and make the database more complete.

It should be done a page for search per city (in the database)  if there is any  place that will receive it.
